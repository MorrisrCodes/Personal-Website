# Personal Website
This is a personal website I made as the first project in my Headstarter fellowship. It is my personalization of a template from the talented front-end developer Brittany Chiang.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for the anime video theme for the background came from a connection I made early into the Headstarter fellowship. Ryan Tran's personal website captivated from the moment I first laid eyes upon it, and I decided I had to incorporate one of his themes into my site. Using my aesthetic anime of choice, "Garden of Words," I created an anime video background that aligns with my personal style.

## Original Template
The original template for this website was created by Brittany Chiang. You can find her GitHub and the original template [here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v3).
